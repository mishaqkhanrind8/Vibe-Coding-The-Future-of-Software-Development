The Evolution of Coding
        </h2>
        <h3>
Rise of High-Level Languages
        </h3>
        <p>
In the early days, programmers had to write instructions directly in machine code or assembly, which was extremely difficult and time-consuming. The introduction of high-level programming languages like <em>FORTRAN (1957)</em> and <em>COBOL (1959)</em> Completely transformed coding. These languages allowed developers to write instructions in a way that was closer to human language, making software development faster, easier, and more accessible. This shift laid the foundation for modern programming, opening the door to innovations that shaped the digital world.

The Future of Collaborative Software
        </h2>
        <h3>
AI-Powered Teamwork
        </h3>
        <p>
In the future, collaboration in software development will go beyond just sharing code on repositories. Artificial Intelligence will act as a smart teammate, helping developers in real-time by suggesting solutions, fixing errors, and even optimizing performance during coding sessions. Instead of waiting for manual code reviews, teams will benefit from <strong>instant AI-driven feedback</strong>. making the process faster and more efficient. This shift will allow developers to focus more on creativity and problem-solving while machines handle repetitive tasks, leading to smarter and more collaborative software development.

AI as Your Coding Partner
    </h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is transforming the way developers write code by acting as a true partner in the process. Tools like <b>GitHub Copilot</b>, <b>ChatGPT</b> and TabNine can generate code snippets, suggest improvements, and even explain complex logic in plain language.
